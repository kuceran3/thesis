When running the created C++ executables it can be done by command:

$$./executable\_name\quad input\_data\quad input\_pattern.csv\quad errors$$  

where input data have to be chunked and name of the meta file is expected, input pattern is a standard csv file with the specified dimensions and attributes, errors is a parameter used only in executables of approximate searches and defines maximum number of errors allowed for the result to still be valid.
